# Hello there, I'm Yazan! 👋
## 🔭 Exploring the Universe of Code and Pixels

I began my academic journey at Uludağ University, diving deep into the mysteries of physics for three years. This exploration of the natural world laid a foundation for my ever-growing curiosity, leading me to a pivotal change in my path. Now, I'm harnessing the logical rigor and mathematical beauty I cherished in physics as a budding software engineer at the innovative and challenging environment of 42 Wolfsburg.

## 🎨 Artistry in Algorithms

But I'm not just about algorithms and data structures. My passion for digital art drives me to blend the precision of code with the boundlessness of creativity. My art is a digital tapestry, transforming geographical data of our magnificent Earth into mesmerizing visual narratives. Through my work, I invite viewers on a journey across pixelated landscapes, exploring the world through a unique lens where technology meets art.
